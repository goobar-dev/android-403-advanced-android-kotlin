# Lab 1 - Explore A New Compose Project

## Observe the project dependencies
- Open the `lab` project in Android Studio
- Sync the project in Android Studio
- Open the root-level `build.gradle` file and observe specified plugins

**ðŸ’¡ What version of the Android Gradle Plugin is the project using?**

**ðŸ’¡ What version of Kotlin is the project using?**

- Open `app/build.gradle` file and observe the project configuration

**ðŸ’¡ What version of Compose is the project using?**
- Check out the [Compose to Kotlin Compatibility Map](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-kotlin) to learn more about what Compose/Kotlin combinations work together.

**ðŸ’¡ What version(s) of Compose libraries is the project using?**

**ðŸ’¡ How are those versions kept in sync?**
- Check out the guide on the [Compose Bill of Materials (BOM)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/bom)

- Observe the Compose-related `debugImplementation` dependencies

**ðŸ’¡ Why do you think those dependencies are only needed for the debug classpath?**

## Build and deploy the project
- Build the project and deploy to a device or emulator

**ðŸ’¡ What output do you see on the screen?**

## Explore a Compose Activity
- Open `MainActivity.kt` and observe the `onCreate()` method

**ðŸ’¡ How does this method differ from what you might be used to in a
non-Compose app?**

## Explore a simple Composable
- Observe the `Greeting` Composable function

**ðŸ’¡ In what ways does the declaration of this function differ from a
normal function?**

## Modify a Composable
- Change the text based to the `Text` Composable, and redeploy to observe the new output
- With `MainActivity.kt` open, select the `Split` or `Design` view from the upper end corner of the editor window
- Observe the Composable preview view
- Change the text passed to the `Greeting` Composable within the preview

**ðŸ’¡ Did you notice the preview text updated automatically?**

- Explore the rest of the project

**ðŸ’¡ What other aspects of this project stick out to you?**

**ðŸ’¡ What questions, if any, does the initial project setup raise?**
