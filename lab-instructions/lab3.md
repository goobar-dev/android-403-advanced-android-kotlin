# Lab 3 - Refactor Compose UI Architecture
Practice refactoring by adding some instrumented tests, refactoring the UI architecture, and verifying the tests still pass.

## Deliverables
- Write a Compose test that validates that the planet list is drawn with the.
- Then, refactor you code so the list of planets if observed from a `ViewModel` using an MVVM pattern.
- Use your test to ensure the refactoring didn't impact app behavior
- For an extra challenge, refactor the details screen to use a ViewModel

## Dev Notes
If you've been building out your own lab during Lab1 & Lab2, feel free to work through this lab in the project you already have set up.

If you missed a lab, or just want to start with a clean slate, you can check out the `lab3-start` tag and start working on Lab3 from there.
