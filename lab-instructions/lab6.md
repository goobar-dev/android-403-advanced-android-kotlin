# Lab 6 - Scheduling Periodic Work
Use WorkManager to schedule a repeating task to show a "Daily Planet" notification

- Integrate WorkManager into the project
- Schedule a repeating task to run every 30 seconds
- Inside the worker, get the list of planets from the database, pick one at random and show a notification

## Challenge
- Add a constraint to your worker such as running only if device is connected to power, or it's idle

## Dev Notes
If you've been building out your own project during Labs 1,2 3, 4 & 5, feel free to work through this lab in the project you already have set up.

If you missed a lab, or just want to start with a clean slate, you can check out the `lab6-start` tag and start working on Lab5 from there.
