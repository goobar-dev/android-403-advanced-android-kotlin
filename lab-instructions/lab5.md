# Lab 5 - Add Offline Support
Add a local database to your application so a list of cached planet data can be viewed when the device is offline

## Deliverables
- Add an `Entity` class to store planet data returned from the api in a local database
- Create a DAO for accessing the planets table
- Create a database for the application that can provide access to the created DAO
- Update your application to use an "offline-first" approach to data by loading data from the database and populating the database asynchronously

## Challenge
- Encrypt the Room database

## Dev Notes
If you've been building out your own project during Labs 1,2 3 & 4, feel free to work through this lab in the project you already have set up.

If you missed a lab, or just want to start with a clean slate, you can check out the `lab5-start` tag and start working on Lab5 from there.
